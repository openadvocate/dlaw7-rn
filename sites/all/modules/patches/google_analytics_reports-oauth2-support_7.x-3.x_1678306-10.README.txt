Case 45682: PLNZ-M - Upgrade/Patch for OAuth2.0
kkim

Google stopped supporting OAuth 1.0 on 4/20/2015, which broke Google Analytics API module.

I finally upgraded Google Analytics API module using posted patch, but not without struggles.

Previous module was google_analytics_reports-7.x-1.3

The patches are at https://www.drupal.org/node/1678306

Used patch is https://www.drupal.org/node/1678306#comment-6731070. Later patches are for the latest dev version.

First upgrade google_analytics_reports to 7.x-3.0-alpha1 and apply the patch. For example,

$ patch -p1 < google_analytics_reports-oauth2-support_7.x-3.x_1678306-10.patch

It will report one minor glitch in .info file, but it can easily be fixed manually.

Any other combination of version and patch will produce too many patch errors. Unless you are comfortable manaually updating changes using diff file, it's not worth it.

Since it now uses OAuth 2.0, it requies extra step of creating new OAuth Client ID/Secret as well as Redirect URIs. Google will tell you what the value of Redirect URIs should be. It should be http://example.com/admin/config/system/google-analytics-reports

The structure of the returned data by Google also changed. Previously we checked for,

if ($feed->results)

but now it should be

if (!empty($feed->results->rows))
